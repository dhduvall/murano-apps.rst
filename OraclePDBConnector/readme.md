# Oracle PDB Connector

## Description

Oracle PDB Connector is a Murano application that provides OpenStack cloud
users with means for self-service provisioning of Oracle Database 12c and
Oracle Multitenant Pluggable DataBases (PDBs). 

This is an unsupported technology preview release not intended for use in
production environments.  It is supported on the Juno and Kilo OpenStack
releases.

## Instructions

1. You must first install and configure Oracle Database 12c with the Oracle
   Multitenant option on Oracle Solaris 11.2.

   Create a file `/etc/oraenv/ora_env.sh` with read/write permissions for
   the `oracle` user, and set the following environment variables (with
   values appropriate for your installation):
 
   ```
   ORACLE_BASE=/path/to/oracle    # The base directory of Oracle database installation
   ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/<oracle12c directory> 
   ORACLE_SID=<sid>               # Oracle System Identifier
   ORADATA=/path/to/data          # Oracle application directory e.g. /u01/app/oracle/oradata
   ORACLE_USER_HOME=/home/oracle  # Home directory of user oracle
   ```

   Now create a file `/etc/oraenv/orapwd`, also with read/write permissions
   for the `oracle` user, and add the names and passwords for the admin and
   system users:

   ```
   ADMIN_USER=
   SYSTEM_USER=
   ADMIN_PWD=
   SYSTEM_USER_PWD=
   ```


2. You will also need the latest Murano agent.

  - Download the latest tarball of murano-agent and its dependent packages on
    the node where Oracle 12c is running.

  - Install each of the package by doing the following,
    ```
    # tar -zxvf <package>.tar.gz
    # cd <package>
    # ./setup build
    # ./setup install
    ```

  - The executable `muranoagent` will be made available in `/usr/bin`.

  - Setup the agent by copying and editing the sample configuration file as
    `/etc/murano/agent.conf`.

  - Edit `/etc/murano/agent.conf` and set `enable_dynamic_result_queue` to
    `True` in the `DEFAULT` section.  Set `input_queue` with queue
    information from the muranoclient

  - Start the agent:
    ```
    # /usr/bin/muranoagent --config-file /etc/murano.conf 
    ```
